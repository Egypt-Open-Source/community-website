## Introduction

Joke-Machine is a small-scale embedded system project that brings entertainment to your ESP32-based devices. By leveraging the Wokwi simulator and integrating API calls, this project fetches jokes and prints them on your connected device.

## Components

- **ESP32:** The project is built on the ESP32 microcontroller, providing the necessary hardware foundation.
- **Wokwi Simulator:** Wokwi is used as a simulation environment, allowing you to test and visualize the project's functionality.
- **API-Based Joke Machine:** The project relies on an external API to fetch jokes and deliver them to the ESP32 for display.

## Getting Started

To set up the Joke-Machine project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Joke-Machine.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.

3. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries.

4. Connect your ESP32 board to your development environment.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, upload the project to your ESP32 device. The Joke-Machine will then connect to the specified API, fetch a joke, and display it on the device. Enjoy the laughter!
